# WebDocs - HTML based word processor

This project came with the disatisfaction of open source word processors for
edition.

Hopefully, the HTML + JavaScript stack would allow more configurable cross
references table of contents and indexes while CSS allors for pretty good
styling.

It uses [PagedJS](https://pagedjs.org) for the page layouts and
[Tauri](https://tauri.app/) for development.

## Development

    npm run tauri dev
